## 1. The Big Picture

### 1.1 What Is CollabNote?

CollabNote is a production-grade, collaborative notes API that students will design, build, and ship as the capstone of the FastAPI Basics episode. It is not a toy example - every architectural decision reflects patterns used in real-world systems at companies like Notion, Linear, and Confluence.

At its core, CollabNote lets authenticated users create and manage rich-text notes, search across them instantly, track every action they take, and consume the same data through both a REST interface and a GraphQL interface. The entire stack runs behind an Nginx load balancer, is containerized with Docker Compose, and is deployed automatically through a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

### 1.2 Why This Project?

Each lab in the FastAPI Basics series taught one isolated skill. CollabNote forces students to combine every skill into a coherent system and make real architectural choices:

- Where does data live - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or both?
- What belongs in a cache, and when should it be invalidated?
- Which actions warrant an asynchronous event stream versus a synchronous database write?
- When does a client benefit from GraphQL over REST?

These are the questions engineers answer every day. CollabNote provides a safe environment to answer them under realistic constraints.

### 1.3 System Architecture Overview

The finished system is composed of eight layers that students will build incrementally across five phases:

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Client | curl / Postman / Browser | Sends HTTP requests to the Nginx entry point |
| Load Balancer | Nginx | Round-robin distributes traffic across two FastAPI instances |
| API Layer | FastAPI (×2) | Handles REST endpoints and the GraphQL /graphql endpoint |
| Auth | JWT + passlib (bcrypt) | Issues and validates Bearer tokens; protects all routes |
| Relational DB | PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Alembic | Stores user profiles and hashed passwords |
| Document DB | MongoDB + Motor | Stores notes (title, content, tags) and activity logs |
| Cache | Redis | Caches hot note reads; invalidated on every write |
| Search Engine | Elasticsearch | Indexes notes on creation; provides fuzzy full-text search |
| Event Bus | Kafka (KRaft) | Receives action events from the API; background consumer writes to MongoDB |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Lints, tests, builds, and pushes Docker images on every main-branch push |

### 1.4 Key User Flows

The following five flows cover the full lifecycle of the system and are used as acceptance criteria:

1. User registers via `POST /auth/signup` → profile stored in PostgreSQL → Kafka publishes signup event → consumer logs it to MongoDB.
2. Authenticated user creates a note via `POST /notes` → document stored in MongoDB → indexed in Elasticsearch → cache invalidated → Kafka publishes `create_note` event.
3. User searches via `GET /search?q=fastapi` → Elasticsearch returns fuzzy-matched, ranked results with highlighted snippets.
4. User reads a hot note via `GET /notes/{id}` → Redis cache hit returns data in < 2 ms; on cache miss, MongoDB is queried and result is cached.
5. Frontend client sends a single GraphQL query to `/graphql` requesting user profile, notes list, and activity log simultaneously — no over-fetching.

### 1.5 What Students Will Submit

A single public GitHub repository containing:

- One `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root that starts the entire stack (Postgres, Mongo, Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Nginx, two FastAPI instances, and the Kafka consumer) with a single `docker compose up` command.
- A working `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that lints (flake8), runs tests (pytest), builds the Docker image, and pushes it to Docker Hub on every push to main.
- A `README.md` with setup instructions, environment variable documentation, and a brief architectural decision log explaining at least three design choices.
- A Phase 0 Infrastructure Requirements Document (described in the next section).

---

## 2. Phase 0 — Infrastructure Requirements Document

### 2.1 Why Phase 0 Exists

Running PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Nginx, and two FastAPI instances simultaneously is resource-intensive. Elasticsearch alone requires a minimum of 512 MB of dedicated heap, and the full stack comfortably consumes 4–6 GB of RAM. Poridhi will provision a correctly-sized VM only after reviewing and approving each student's requirements document.

> ⚠️ Students will NOT receive a Poridhi VM for this capstone until their Phase 0 document is submitted and approved. This is the mandatory first step.

### 2.2 What the Requirements Document Must Contain

The document must be submitted as a PDF or Markdown file named `requirements.md` (or `requirements.pdf`) in the root of the student's GitHub repository. It must address all five sections below:

#### Section A — Service Inventory

A table listing every service the student plans to run, the Docker image they will use, the port it will expose, and a one-sentence description of its role.

| Service | Docker Image | Port(s) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | postgres:16 | 5432 | Relational store for user profiles |
| MongoDB | mongo:7 | 27017 | Document store for notes and logs |
| Redis | redis:7-alpine | 6379 | Cache layer for hot note reads |
| Kafka | confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0 | 9092 | Event bus for activity streaming |
| Elasticsearch | docker.elastic.co/...8.11.1 | 9200 | Full-text search index |
| FastAPI (×2) | custom build | 8001, 8002 | Application layer |
| Nginx | nginx:1.25-alpine | 80 | Load balancer and reverse proxy |
| Kafka Consumer | custom build | — | Background event processor |

#### Section B — Resource Estimate

A best-estimate breakdown of RAM and CPU required by each service. Students must calculate this from their service inventory and derive a total. The total RAM figure is the primary input Poridhi uses to size the VM.

| Service | Min RAM (MB) | Min CPU (cores) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elasticsearch | 512 | 0.5 | `-Xms256m -Xmx256m` JVM flags required |
| PostgreSQL | 128 | 0.25 | `shared_buffers` default is sufficient |
| MongoDB | 128 | 0.25 | WiredTiger cache can be capped |
| Kafka (KRaft) | 256 | 0.25 | Single broker for dev/learning |
| Redis | 64 | 0.1 | Append-only file mode enabled |
| FastAPI (×2) | 128 | 0.25 | Per instance estimate |
| Nginx | 32 | 0.1 | Alpine image, minimal footprint |
| Kafka Consumer | 64 | 0.1 | Single Python process |
| OS + overhead | 512 | 0.5 | Buffer for OS and Docker daemon |
| **TOTAL** | **~1824 MB (~2 GB)** | **~2.3 cores** | Request VM with 4 GB RAM / 4 vCPU |

#### Section C — Data Model Summary

A brief description (prose or table) of every collection and table the student plans to create, the key fields, and which service owns that data. This helps reviewers verify the student understands the hybrid architecture before writing code.

#### Section D — Endpoint Inventory

A list of every REST endpoint and every GraphQL query/mutation the student plans to implement, grouped by phase. Students do not need to define request/response schemas at this stage - just the method, path, and one-line purpose.

#### Section E — Architecture Decision Log (ADL)

At least three short paragraphs, each following the format: context → decision → rationale. Examples:

- Why notes are stored in MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL.
- Why Redis TTL is set to one hour rather than indefinite.
- Why the Kafka consumer runs as a separate process rather than a FastAPI background task.

### 2.3 Approval Process

Instructors review the submitted requirements document within 48 hours. Approval is granted when:

1. The service inventory is complete and ports do not conflict.
2. The resource estimate is realistic and the requested VM size is justified.
3. The data model correctly separates relational from document data.
4. The ADL shows genuine reasoning, not copy-pasted answers.

> ✅ Once approved, Poridhi will provide access to the Lab VM with the appropriate specifications.

---

## 3. Phased Product Requirements Document

The project is divided into five phases. Each phase builds directly on the previous. Students should commit after each phase is working end-to-end before advancing.

> 📌 Rule: No phase is considered complete until `docker compose up` starts the full stack that phase introduces, all endpoints return correct responses, and all existing tests continue to pass.

---

### Phase 1 — Foundation: Auth, Users, and Notes

**Labs:** 2 · 3 · 4 · 5  
**Services:** PostgreSQL · MongoDB · FastAPI  
**Goal:** A working authenticated API backed by two databases.

#### Functional Requirements

- `POST /auth/signup` — Accept email, username, password. Hash password with bcrypt. Store user in PostgreSQL. Return UserOut (no password).
- `POST /auth/login` — Accept username and password via OAuth2 form data. Verify credentials. Return JWT Bearer token.
- `GET /profile` — Protected. Return the authenticated user's profile from PostgreSQL.
- `POST /notes` — Protected. Accept title, content, tags. Store note document in MongoDB with the authenticated user's ID. Return NoteOut.
- `GET /notes` — Protected. Return all notes belonging to the authenticated user from MongoDB.
- `GET /notes/{id}` — Protected. Return a single note by MongoDB ObjectId.
- `PUT /notes/{id}` — Protected. Update note fields. Only the note owner may update.
- `DELETE /notes/{id}` — Protected. Delete note from MongoDB. Only the note owner may delete.
- `GET /users/{user_id}/notes` — Protected. Hybrid endpoint: verify user exists in PostgreSQL, then fetch all their notes from MongoDB.

#### Data Models

**PostgreSQL — users table**

| Column | Type |
|---|---|
| id | PK |
| email | unique |
| username | unique |
| password_hash | |
| created_at | |
| is_active | |

**MongoDB — notes collection**

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| _id | ObjectId |
| user_id | str |
| title | |
| content | |
| tags | array |
| created_at | |

#### Alembic Migrations

- Initial migration creates users table.
- Second migration adds `is_active` column (demonstrates schema evolution).

#### Docker Compose Services (Phase 1)

- `postgres` — postgres:16
- `mongodb` — mongo:7
- `api` — FastAPI application (single instance at this stage)

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. `docker compose up` starts all three services without error.
2. `POST /auth/signup` followed by `POST /auth/login` returns a valid JWT.
3. `POST /notes` with a valid JWT creates a note retrievable by `GET /notes/{id}`.
4. `GET /users/{user_id}/notes` returns the correct notes from MongoDB after verifying the user in PostgreSQL.
5. pytest passes a minimum of six tests covering signup, login, note CRUD, and the hybrid endpoint.

---

### Phase 2 — Search and Caching

**Labs:** 6 · 7  
**Services added:** Elasticsearch · Redis  
**Goal:** Sub-10ms search and cached hot note reads.

#### Functional Requirements

- Extend `POST /notes`: After writing to MongoDB, also index the note in Elasticsearch (title, content, tags, created_at).
- Extend `PUT /notes/{id}`: After updating MongoDB, re-index in Elasticsearch and delete the Redis cache key `note:{id}`.
- Extend `DELETE /notes/{id}`: After deleting from MongoDB, remove from Elasticsearch and delete Redis cache key.
- `GET /search?q={term}` — Public or protected (student's choice). Execute a `multi_match` Elasticsearch query across title (boosted 3x) and content. Enable `fuzziness: AUTO`. Return results sorted by relevance score with highlighted snippets.
- Extend `GET /notes/{id}`: Check Redis first (key `note:{id}`). On cache miss, query MongoDB, then write to Redis with TTL = 3600 s. On cache hit, return immediately with source header `Cache: HIT`.

#### Configuration

- `vm.max_map_count` must be set to `262144` before starting Elasticsearch (document this in the README and in the docker-compose healthcheck `start_period`).
- `ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx256m` to keep Elasticsearch within the provisioned VM limits.
- Redis TTL is configurable via `CACHE_TTL` environment variable (default 3600).

#### Cache Invalidation Rules

| Operation | MongoDB | Redis Action |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /notes/{id}` | Read | Write to cache on miss |
| `PUT /notes/{id}` | Update | DELETE cache key `note:{id}` |
| `DELETE /notes/{id}` | Delete | DELETE cache key `note:{id}` |
| `POST /notes` | Insert | No action (not cached until first GET) |

#### Docker Compose Services (Phase 2 additions)

- `elasticsearch` — docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.11.1
- `redis` — redis:7-alpine with `appendonly yes`

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Creating a note indexes it in Elasticsearch; `DELETE /search` verifies the document is removed after deletion.
2. `GET /search?q=fastapi` returns relevant notes with highlighted terms. Searching for a common typo (e.g., `fastpi`) still returns results.
3. Second consecutive `GET /notes/{id}` is served from Redis (confirm via logs or `Cache: HIT` header) and responds in under 5 ms locally.
4. Updating a note and then immediately fetching it returns the updated content (cache invalidated correctly).

---

### Phase 3 — Event Streaming with Kafka

**Lab:** 8  
**Services added:** Kafka (KRaft) · Kafka Consumer  
**Goal:** Decouple activity logging from the request path.

#### Functional Requirements

- Configure an `aiokafka` AIOKafkaProducer in the FastAPI application that publishes to the topic `collabnote_events`.
- Publish an event to Kafka (non-blocking, fire-and-forget) on every one of the following actions: `user_signup`, `user_login`, `note_created`, `note_updated`, `note_deleted`, `note_searched`.
- Each event payload must contain: `event_type`, `user_id`, `resource_id` (where applicable), `timestamp` (ISO 8601), and a `metadata` dict.
- Build a standalone Kafka consumer in `consumer/consumer.py` that reads from `collabnote_events` and writes each event as a document to the MongoDB `activity_logs` collection.
- Expose `GET /activity` — Protected. Return the last 20 activity log entries for the authenticated user, sorted by timestamp descending, from MongoDB.

#### Event Schema

| Field | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| event_type | string | `note_created` |
| user_id | int | `42` |
| resource_id | string \| null | `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011` |
| timestamp | ISO 8601 string | `2025-02-25T14:30:00Z` |
| metadata | object | `{"title": "My Note", "tags": ["api"]}` |

#### Architecture Note

The Kafka consumer must run as a separate process (`python -m consumer.consumer`), not as a FastAPI background task. This is intentional: it demonstrates process-level decoupling and allows the consumer to be scaled independently of the API.

#### Docker Compose Services (Phase 3 additions)

- `kafka` — confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0 in KRaft mode (no Zookeeper).
- `consumer` — custom image built from `consumer/Dockerfile`, depends on kafka and mongodb.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. `POST /auth/login` followed by `GET /activity` returns a log entry with `event_type: user_login`.
2. Creating, updating, and deleting a note each produce exactly one corresponding event in the `activity_logs` collection.
3. Stopping the consumer, performing several actions, restarting it with `auto_offset_reset=earliest`, and verifying all queued events are processed.
4. API response time for `POST /notes` is not meaningfully affected by the Kafka publish operation (publish is non-blocking).

---

### Phase 4 — GraphQL Interface

**Lab:** 11  
**No new services** — mounts onto existing FastAPI instance  
**Goal:** Expose the full data graph in a single `/graphql` endpoint.

#### GraphQL Schema Requirements

- **Type User:** id, username, email, createdAt, notes (resolver → MongoDB), activityLogs (resolver → MongoDB activity_logs).
- **Type Note:** id, userId, title, content, tags, createdAt, author (resolver → PostgreSQL user).
- **Type ActivityLog:** id, eventType, userId, resourceId, timestamp, metadata.

#### Queries

- `me` — Returns the authenticated user's profile (reads JWT from context).
- `user(id: ID!)` — Returns a user by PostgreSQL ID.
- `users` — Returns all users.
- `note(id: ID!)` — Returns a single note by MongoDB ObjectId.
- `notes` — Returns all notes for the authenticated user.

#### Mutations

- `createNote(title: String!, content: String!, tags: [String!]!)` — Creates a note (same logic as `POST /notes`, including Elasticsearch indexing and Kafka event).
- `updateUser(id: ID!, username: String, email: String)` — Updates user profile in PostgreSQL.

#### The Dashboard Query (Primary Test)

The following query must execute correctly in GraphiQL and return all three data sources in a single round trip:

```graphql
query CollabNoteDashboard {
  me {
    username
    email
    notes {
      title
      tags
      createdAt
    }
    activityLogs {
      eventType
      timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

#### Authentication in GraphQL Context

The Strawberry GraphQL router must read the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, decode the JWT, and make the authenticated user available in the resolver context. Queries that access user-specific data (`me`, `notes`, `activityLogs`) must return a 401 error if no valid token is present.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Opening `/graphql` in a browser renders the GraphiQL playground.
2. The CollabNoteDashboard query above executes and returns coherent data from all three sources.
3. Running `createNote` mutation creates a note visible in both `GET /notes` (REST) and the `notes` GraphQL query.
4. Calling `notes` without an Authorization header returns an authentication error.

---

### Phase 5 — Production Deployment: Nginx + CI/CD

**Labs:** 9 · 10  
**Services added:** Nginx · GitHub Actions  
**Goal:** The full stack runs behind a load balancer and deploys automatically.

#### Nginx Load Balancer Requirements

- Run two FastAPI containers (`api1` and `api2`) on internal ports 8001 and 8002.
- Nginx listens on port 80 and distributes traffic across both instances using round-robin.
- `nginx.conf` must define an upstream block with `max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s` on each backend.
- Each FastAPI instance must respond with an `X-Instance-ID` header so students can verify round-robin distribution.
- Nginx must proxy `/graphql` requests to the same upstream pool.

#### GitHub Actions CI/CD Requirements

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow must:

1. Trigger on push to `main` and on all pull requests.
2. Run flake8 linting (critical errors E9, F63, F7, F82; max line length 88).
3. Run pytest with coverage; fail if coverage falls below 60%.
4. Build a Docker image for the FastAPI application.
5. Push the image to Docker Hub tagged as: `latest` and `{branch}-{sha}`.
6. The build and push jobs must run only after the test job passes (`needs: test`).

> ⚠️ The deploy job (SSH to VM and `docker pull`) is optional and will not be assessed for grading. Students who implement it receive bonus credit.

#### Required GitHub Secrets

| Name | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | Secret | Docker Hub access token for image push |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | Variable | Docker Hub username for image tagging |
| EC2_HOST | Secret | Optional: EC2 IP for bonus deploy job |
| EC2_USERNAME | Secret | Optional: EC2 SSH username |
| EC2_SSH_KEY | Secret | Optional: EC2 private key PEM content |

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. `docker compose up` starts all services including two FastAPI instances and Nginx.
2. Sending six consecutive curl requests to port 80 shows alternating `X-Instance-ID` values.
3. Stopping one FastAPI instance and sending requests shows all traffic routes to the surviving instance.
4. Pushing a commit to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow; the test, build, and push jobs all pass.
5. The built Docker image appears on Docker Hub tagged with both `latest` and the commit SHA.
